The website is mainly based on Javascipt, Html and CSS. I had this website early in  my sophomore year, and Covid was at its peak during that time. I used api.ipgeolocation to get the country code and country name. The API used is "covid19api". This API provided  correct data until August 3, 2021, but  has not provided  data on recovered patients since then.
